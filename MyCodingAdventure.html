    <div id="mainsection"><h2><i>The Book</i></h2>
    <p>My Mom had got me a book.<br>
    It's called <i>Coding For Minecrafters</i>,<br>
   and it's based on, you guessed it, Minecraft.<br>
  Although cheesy, it helped me maked a cool web-<br>
  site... </p></div>
  <div id="mainsection"><h2>Zonzer</h2>
  <p>This is the website you are looking<br>
  at right now. This is the website that <i>The Book</i><br>
  brought me to make. Why did I make it? For fun.<br>
  How many more am I going to make? I don't know.<br> This is the website that started my<br>
  coding adventure</p></div>
  <div id="mainsection"><h3>Stick Wars</h3>
  <p>My dream. My goal with coding. Stick Wars is a game<br>
  me and my brothers made up where you draw a fort, stalk it<br>
  with weapons, try to break into the other's fort, and defeat <br>
  your opponent's stick-figure, and its all done on paper.<br>
  Once I learn some more code, I plan to make this video-<br>
  game ASAP.</p></div>
